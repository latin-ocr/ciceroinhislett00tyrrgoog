xl · CICERO IN HIS LETTERS

road to a fortune neglected by Oiccro was the practice of

usury.1 Itis a singular feature in the social life 01 this
period, that men 01 the highest distinction lent money on

interest 10 individuale and corporations. Brutus, though
according 1ο Shakspere he condemned Gessius for his
itching palm, had large transactione 01 this kind, and
it was thus that Atticus amassed the wealth which he
knew so well how 10 keep. Nor was this trade confined
to men. Thereis much reason to believe that Terentia
seriously embarrassed her husband by speculatione, iu
which she allowed herself to be defrauded by her steward
and freedman Philotimus. anrellia,2 too, seems 10 have
had extensive business transactione. From these Oicero

¹ This mode 01 acquiring wealth was by nc meane deemed dis·
reputable in Rome. But cicero does not seem to have sought
thus 10 add 10 his resources. He uses, in one 01 his letters to
Quintus (Q. Fr. 1 3, 6), an expression which seems designedly
employed to show that his means were more honourably acquired.

did not look down on trade. In Parad. 6 1111111101,ραί 10111111

the 1111011011 which Scipio, in the Republic (i. 35), claims, cum mibi

² This interesting woman (the loss 01 whose correspondence with ,
Cicerois much to be regretted) for many years ufforded to him
that intelligent sympathy in his literary labours which he sought
in vain from Terentia. She was the Stella 01 Cicero. That the
intimacy partock in no degree 01 the nature 01 an intrigue is plain

Terentia Yet the rancour 01 Dio Cassius has not recoiled even
from this aspersion Like swift. comte, and'Goethe, Cicero felt
