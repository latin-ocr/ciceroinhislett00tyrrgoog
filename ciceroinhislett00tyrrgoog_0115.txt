APPENDIX TO INTRODUOTION

DINERS OUT

Anu great eities ebound with little men, whose object it is to
be sters of the dinner-teble, end grand purveyore of ell tho
etrey j0kes of the town. So long es these oonfine themselves to
ietoh end eerry for their mesters they sueeeed tolerably well,
but the moment they set up for originality‚ end turn manuleo-
turere insteed of retulere, they ere ruined. Like the hind
wheel of the oerriege whieh is in eonstent pureuit of the fore
without ever overteking it; so these beoome the doubles of e

· Selwyn or e Sheriden, but without ever coming up to them.
’ They ere constently neer wit without being witty, es hie velot
is elweye neer e great men without being great.

A MOTLEY OREW

Bur with every oure the oemp still presented en imeguler end
unoouth eppeerenee. A spy who wes sent from Englend ebout
the middle of October reports es follows :-They oonsiet of en
odd medley of grey beerde end no beerds-old men fit to drop
into the greve, end young boye whose ewords ere near equel to
their weight, end I reelly believe more then their length.
Four or five thousand mey be very good determined men, but
the rest ere mean, dhty, villeinous·looking reseels, who seem
more anxious for plunder then their prinee, end would be better
pleeeed with four shillings then e erown.
